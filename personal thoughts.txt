The program was fun, or not. At first, getopt is foreign to me and I am able to open up to new functions and get the right values. However, they are way too many library fuynctions for error checking and I am afraid I missed out on some library functions. I was thinking of making helper functions for error checking but it will be pointless since the return values are different.

My program is followed up by read input from stdin and from a file if there are more arguments left after the options. Afterwards, it was quite a trouble for me to implement the reading file process as I could not get the right way to read the right length and output after sorting. Especially to differenciate -n or none. 

I did succeed on passing the basic test by passing the -n value to a temporary integer. Then assign the true length of the array to the old integer.
